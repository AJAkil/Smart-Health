Project Instructions

1. Select a sleep apnea database (e.g. apnea-ecg database from Physionet) and read the dataset descriptions to identify the healthy and apnea subjects.</br>
2. Download all the records, and process the records to extract HRV features using a software (e.g. HRVanalysis) or in python.</br>
3. Visualize/compare the features using descriptive statistics between healthy and apneic subjects.</br>
4. Use inferential statistics (e.g. t-test, Mann-Whitney U test) to find if there is any significant difference between the groups. </br>
